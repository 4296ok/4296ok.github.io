    iâ€™m free, i think. i shut my eyes and think hard and deep about how free i am, but i canâ€™t really understand what it means. all i know is iâ€™m totally alone. all alone in an unfamiliar place, like some solitary explorer whoâ€™s lost his compass and
    his map. is this what it means to be free? i donâ€™t know, and I give up thinking about it.<br />
    i always knew i was meant for something bigger. growing up with this off-beat feeling of being an outsider led me to a very dark moment in my life. realizing my goals and dreams were like a helping hand to get out of it. so how is it related with
    my dream? well... my dream is to get out of my comfort zone and explore the world. the world in general, the world as a its components, the world as whole. pursuing my goal fiercely i know there is no turning back to my old life. everyday i wake
    up with the feeling that this is not my reality, that i don't belong here. and i don't mean the world, just the particular place i'm stuck rn. i want to escape ðŸ’® my dream is to see japan in ten years max. japanese culture was the biggest
    inspiration for me durnig my whole life. this culture affected me in a ways nothing else did. though i don't consider it perfect in the political aspect i sure do glorify its visuals, food and culture. i wish to be bathed in the neon lights and
    to lose myself in variety of sounds and smells. starting in hokkaido i hope to be able to wade the whole japan and end in okinawa richer in experience which i am aiming for my entire life. Why are the Japanese seen in a dream? Dream
    Interpretation believes that the appearance of these characters in a dream can mean anything, but first recommends preparing for a family showdown due to the bad deeds of your friends.

    Why do Japanese people come to your dreams? You will take up a very unexpected business or unexpectedly advance at work. In addition, the Japanese in a dream symbolize silent hostility and the need for spiritual knowledge.

    Did you dream of Japanese foreigners? Suddenly, troubles will begin where you least expect them. But the dream book insists: do not look for the guilty one, all this is a consequence only of your own erroneous actions.

    If you came to Japan and met with locals there in a dream, it is better to abandon long trips, and even more so traveling to exotic lands for some time. You can get into a terrible natural disaster.

    A dream visit to the Japanese islands predicts truly heroic behavior in an extreme situation. Did you dream of the Japanese in their homeland? Such plot means that cunning and unreliable people have gathered around you.


    Did you happen to meet foreigners in your own city? This means that you definitely will not cope with a certain responsible assignment.

    Why does one sees the Japanese in a dream, according to Millerâ€™s dream book? If you liked the characters in a dream, this means unusual circumstances will turn out in the most favorable way. If foreigners have caused distrust, then you should
    prepare for disappointment. Seeing yourself Japanese is about making faithful, albeit a few eccentric friends.

    If you dad an aggressive Japanese in a dream, the dream interpretation considers that you should face unreasonable cruelty.

    Did it happen to see a Japanese in the night plot? In reality, you will have to come to terms with the opinions of others. If you met a Japanese woman, this means you will take part in an exotic event.

    What is the meaning of your dream if you find yourself in a society of Japanese people? In fact, youâ€™ll move to a new place of residence, perhaps to another country, where it will be long and difficult for you to get used to a different way of
    life and traditions.

    The dream interpretation also considers that in such an interesting way the conflict of the dreamer with society or some inexplicable situation is transmitted.

    To a girl to see a resident of the land of the rising sun means that you need to dream less about foreign life.

    Did you have a dream about Japanese? Dream Interpretation suggests recalling what you did in a dream.
    Married - trouble.
    Accepted citizenship - doubtful prospects, friends.
    Making love - fulfillment of desire.
    Friendly communication - new opportunities.
    They fought, cursed - conflict, misunderstanding.
    The dream interpretation recalls: any foreigners in a dream symbolize some unfamiliar business. Moreover, if the Japanese were seen, then it is not at all necessary that the enterprise will be connected precisely with this country or its
    traditions. It just will seem very unusual to you.

    A further interpretation of a dream will tell you whether you can handle it or not. If you quickly found common language with foreigners, then everything will go well.

    Any difficulties in communication are interpreted as obstacles and difficulties in fulfilling the goal. Think: maybe itâ€™s better to refuse right away than to waste a lot of energy in vain?
